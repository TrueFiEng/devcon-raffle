            In an effort to make our ticket distribution more efficient and fair, we are selling a{' '}
            <Italic>portion</Italic> of this year’s tickets via an on-chain Auction & Raffle. Typically we sell tickets
            in waves; attendees need to wait for a specific release time and refresh the ticket shop rapidly in order to{' '}
            <Italic>hope</Italic> to claim & checkout with a ticket. Not to mention the need for a speedy internet
            connection and crossing your fingers that you’re close enough to our ticketing servers to be one of the
            first to secure a ticket.

            This year, we wanted to try something different, so we are experimenting with an on-chain Auction & Raffle
            to sell a <Italic>portion</Italic> of Devcon tickets.

            Join the contest by submitting a bid for the ticket based on the amount you would value having a Devcon
            ticket. Bid high to compete for the 20 tickets distributed in the auction, or be entered into the raffle for
            a chance to buy a ticket at the reserve price. You need to bid at least the reserve price, which is set to
            the price of a standard Devcon ticket at time of publication: <Bold>{reservePrice} ETH.</Bold> Please note
            there is a one-person-one-bid rule in place. You will need to submit your name at check-out, and we will
            check IDs at Devcon to verify that the participant is the ticket holder.

            Place a bid of at least {reservePrice} ETH for a chance to win a Devcon ticket. If your bid is in the top{' '}
            {auctionWinnersCount}, you will win a Devcon ticket in exchange for the amount you paid in your bid. At any
            point, you can top up your bid if you want. If your bid is not in the top {auctionWinnersCount}, you will be
            entered into a raffle and may be randomly chosen to win a Devcon ticket — if you were randomly selected in
            the Raffle & bid more than the reserve price, you can withdraw the difference. If you do not win, you can
            withdraw your entire bid, minus a 2% sybil-resistance fee.
